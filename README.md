# Deploy 3CX and Twilio Elastic SIP

This configuration does two things:
1. Deploys an Amazon EC2 instance with an AMI from 3CX.
2. Creates and configures an Elastic SIP trunk on Twilio.

You will have to buy the phone number and configure the phone number to work with the trunk
on your own.

You will also need to configure 3CX on your own by logging in at the webpage.
